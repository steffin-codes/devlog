# Hello World

Hello, everyone! This is my first post! It was made for me to see how github markdown works!

I will also show a quick Markdown tutorial. This will help me see how the the Markdown renders.

Enjoy!

## Text

Typing normal text will display normal text.

EX `Normal text`

You must put one line of empty space to separate sentences.

EX: `Some text`

`more text`

## Italics and Bold

To make a word _italic_, you must put a `_` before and after the word.

EX: `_italic_`

To make a word **bold** you add `**` before and after the word.

EX: `**bold**`

You can also make a word **_Italic and Bold_** (using both `_` and `**`) and you can **_use it on multiple words_**.

EX: `**_multiple words_**`

## Headers

You can make headers with the hash mark `#`.

You can go from Header 1 to Header 6 by using more `#`.

EX: `# Header 1`

`## Header 2`
## Header 2

`### Header 3`
### Header 3

`#### Header 4`
#### Header 4

`##### Header 5`
##### Header 5

`###### Header 6`
###### Header 6

If you want to see a Header 1 example, look at the top of the page.

## Links

To make a link to another website, you put the description in brackets `[]` and the website in parenthesis `()`.

EX: `[Visit GitHub!](https://github.com)`

[Visit GitHub!](https://github.com)

You can also make links that redirect to another place in the document.

EX: `Join [GitHub][github]!`

`[github]: https://www.github.com`

You usually want to put the definitions (the `[github]: https://www.github.com` part) at the bottom of the file.

Join [GitHub][github]!

## Images

Images work just like links, but you have an `!` in front.

The text in the brackets `[]` is called `alt text` in case if the image doesn't load correctly

EX: `![some image](https://picsum.photos/100)`

![some image](https://picsum.photos/100)
